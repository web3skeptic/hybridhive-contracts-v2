# HybridHive smart contracts

Frontend application: https://github.com/markfender/hybridhive-app

HybridHive is a novel token protocol that aims to solve the dilemma of choosing between multi-currency systems that drain value from the real economy, and single currency systems that lead to loss of sovereignty. It combines the advantages of single and multi-currency systems, providing local control, increasing liquidity, reducing risk and most importantly a severe decrease in transaction costs. It enables the creation of unlimited sub-communities with their own currencies, linked through “hives”.
